CS 336: pylucene is very buggy right now and libraries aren't updated

i originally intended on building my IR system for Intelligent Info Retrieval (CS 336) using pylucene, 
as it might make for a more flexible and powerful IR system. i also highly prefer python over java.

however, i would have many errors stating "not implemented" for non-interface classes. 
for example, using the class StringReader would return this error, which you would expect if you had tried to 
implement the interface Reader. after doing some research, i gathered that because not all of the python libraries
for the most recent version of pylucene are updated (while the older versions are deprecated), there might be too
many potential bugs for me to complete this project within the scope of the semester. i was in fact warned by other
users of pylucene that there are many bugs

therefore, i am saving this project to come back to after i have successfully implemented the java lucene IR system.
